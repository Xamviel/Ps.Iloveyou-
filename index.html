<h1>MY THOUGHTS DURING OUR TIME TOGETHER!</h1><br>

	<h2>COFFEE!</h2>
<p>This was our first meet up after almost 5 years! I was really nervous, I didn't know how much you've change and it worried me. When we met up, I was so relieved that you hadn't changed much (in attitude). You reminded me so much of our past conversations back in elementary it almost made me cry. To wrap it up though, I did enjoy catching up with you as we eat the vegetables with the side of fries :></p><br>
<h2>Hangout at My House</h2>
<p>At the start, I honestly thought you wouldn't come because it was raining that day. I also didn't expect that you'd actually be willing to hangout at my house. It was so fun teaching you how to play Valorant and watching you play arsenal. (ps. those sounds you make are so distracting but also very cute :))</p><br>
<h2>Kareoke</h2>
<p>This day was so amazing, we spent our time going around Sm and even went to Kareoke! I loved singing with you but I wish I could've heard your singing voice more. You were singing so quietly I had to lower my voice just to hear you. When I did hear your voice, I was really captivated and I enjoyed listening to you sing. (Next time we meet, I'm making you sing solo >:))</p><br>
<h2>Movie(in cinemas and at home)</h2>
<p>The movie we watched was so beautiful! You know what else is beautiful? Yeah, You~ ðŸ’– Anyways, the movie made me cry in several occasions, I also heard you wimpering. The subtle jokes we'd make and just the thought of watching the movie with you made me really happy. Btw, where's my umbrella? ðŸ¤” <br><br>
On the other hand, the time when we watched fnaf at my place, made me nervous and worsened my cold haha. It was also the day when I gave you the gift with my confession, it honestly made me really sad because I thought that day was when I would lose you again... But it all turned out great so YAY! I'm really glad you liked the gifts though, I wasn't really sure if you would. (Idk what to gift girls, I don't really give gifts to girls haha)</p>
<h2>Final note</h2>
<p>I wanted to tell you that I'm really grateful that we met again. All the time we spent together really made my mundane life livelier. Even though it was just for a short time, it was really the happiest I have ever been in a long while. I hope it made you happy too. Even after you left, the conversations we had and the time we played together meant so much to me. I honestly hope that we really do last. In the upcoming 2024, I want to enjoy more together even if its online. To sum it all up, I love the time we spent together and I love you! ðŸ’“<p>
